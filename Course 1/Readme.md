## Module 1:

- Define data science and its importance in todayâ€™s data driven world.
- List some paths that can lead to a career in data science.
- Summarize advice given by seasoned data science professionals to data scientists who are just starting out.
- Articulate why data science is considered the most in-demand job in the 21st century.
- Describe what a typical day in the life of a data scientist looks like.
- Define some of the commonly used terms in data science.
- Summarize the impact of cloud technologies on data science.
- Identify some of the key qualities of a successful data scientist.

**Resume:** Data science is the study of large quantities of data, which can reveal insights that help organizations make strategic choices. New data scientists need to be curious, judgemental and argumentative.

## Module 2:

- Define Big Data and its distinguishing characteristics, such as velocity, volume, veracity, and value.
- Describe how Hadoop and other big data tools, combined with distributed computing power, are triggering digital transformation.
- List some of the skills required to be a data scientist and analyze big data. List some of the skills required to analyze big data.
- Explain what data mining is.
- Summarize the importance of establishing goals, data selection, preprocessing, transformation, and storage of data in preparation for data mining.
- Explain the difference between deep learning and machine learning.
- Describe regression and how it might be used to predict market behavior and trend analysis.

**Resume:** 
  - **Big Data:** refers to data sets that are so massive, so quickly built, and so varied that they defy traditional analysis methods such as you might perform with a relational database.  Its often described in terms of five V's; velocity, volume, variety, veracity, and value. 
  - **Data mining:** is the process of automatically searching and analyzing data, discovering previously unrevealed patterns. It involves preprocessing the data to prepare it and transforming it into an appropriate format. Once this is done, insights and patterns are mined and extracted using various tools and techniques ranging from simple data visualization tools to machine learning and statistical models.
  - **Machine learning:** is a subset of AI that uses computer algorithms to analyze data and make intelligent decisions based on what it is learned without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms are trained with large sets of data and they learn from examples. They do not follow rules-based algorithms. Machine learning is what enables machines to solve problems on their own and make accurate predictions using the provided data. 
  - **Deep learning:** is a specialized subset of machine learning that uses layered neural networks to simulate human decision-making. Deep learning algorithms can label and categorize information and identify patterns. 

## Module 3:
  - Describe the application of data science in healthcare.
  - Explain how companies can start on their data science journey.
  - Describe some of the ways in which data is generated by consumers.
  - Describe how businesses such as Netflix, Amazon, UPS, Google, and Apple are using data generated by their consumers and employees.
  - Compare some of the qualities that differentiate data scientists from qualities of other data professionals.
  - Articulate the purpose of the final deliverable of a data science project and the role of storytelling in the final deliverable.
  - Describe what the final report of a Data Science project should cover and how it should be structured for best results.
  - Demonstrate your understanding of data science by articulating what data scientists do and what a data science report contains. Evaluate assignments submitted by fellow learners. Award points, provide constructive feedback, and offer ideas and suggestions that fellow learners can apply right away.

**Resume:** Capturing data is the first step. Then can begin analysing it. Businesses like Netflix, Amazon, UPs, Google, and Apple use the data generated by their consumers and employees. The purpose of the final deliverable of a Data Science project is to communicate new information and insights from the data analysis to key decision-makers. The length and content of the final report will vary. The structure should include a cover page, table of contents, executive summary, detailed contents, acknowledgements, references and appendices. Should present a thorough analysis of the data and communicate the project findings.


### IBM Cloud Gallery

IBM Cloud Gallery is a growing collection of data sets, notebooks, and project templates.

  - **Example 1**: The data is related to forest fires where the aim is to predict the burned area of forest fires, in the northeast region of Portugal, by using meterological and other data.

  - **Example 2**: This data can be used in various ways - To analyze the star ratings of places, to analyze the location preferences of the customers, to analyze the tone and sentiment of customer reviews and many more. Airbnb uses location data to improve guest satisfaction.

  - **Example 3**: This notebook shows you how Decision Optimization can help to prescribe decisions for a complex constrained problem using Python to help determine the optimal location for a new store. The objective is to minimize the total distance from libraries to coffee shops so that a book reader always gets to our coffee shop easily. It can be done by analyzing and displaying the location of the coffee shops on a map.
